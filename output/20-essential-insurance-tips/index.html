                        <h3>Beliefs About Coverage Limits</h3>
<p>Another misconception is that insurance fully covers all expenses related to a claim. In reality, policies often have limits and exclusions, so it&#39;s crucial to read the fine print and understand what is and isn&#39;t covered.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Myths Surrounding Claims Process</h3>

<p>Data analytics is playing a pivotal role in the insurance sector, allowing companies to analyze vast amounts of information to offer personalized products and improve underwriting processes. This trend is enhancing customer experiences and operational efficiency.</p>
