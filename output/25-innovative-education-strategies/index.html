                        <h3>Traditional Schools (K-12)</h3>
<p>Traditional K-12 schools are the foundation of education for children and adolescents. These institutions follow a structured curriculum and provide a comprehensive education that includes academic subjects, arts, and physical education. They play a critical role in socializing children and preparing them for higher education or vocational paths.</p>

They play a vital role in workforce development and economic growth.</p>

                            
                        <h2>3. Key Trends in the Education Sector</h2>

                            
                        <h3>Rise of Online Learning</h3>

                        <h3>Competition from Alternative Education Providers</h3>

                        <h3>Adapting to Changing Student Needs</h3>
